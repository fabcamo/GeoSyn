# GeoSyn

**GeoSyn** is an open-source Python tool for generating synthetic geotechnical 2D cross-sections. It was developed to support data-driven applications in geotechnical engineering by creating realistic and diverse training datasets for machine learning (ML) models.

This tool allows users to define key subsurface parameters, including:

- Number of layers  
- Geometry of layer boundaries (via sine/cosine functions)  
- Material categories and properties  
- Spatial heterogeneity using anisotropic Gaussian random fields

Each synthetic cross-section can represent any scalar geotechnical property such as:

- Soil type (e.g., sand, clay)  
- Soil Behaviour Type Index (Ic)  
- Permeability  
- Undrained shear strength  
- Any other scalar property expressible in 2D

## üîç Example Use Case

GeoSyn was used in the following peer-reviewed study to train a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that reconstructs geotechnical stratigraphy from sparse CPT data:

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabcamo/GeoSyn.git
cd GeoSyn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

To generate the synthetic images, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
``` 

The script will generate a synthetic database of geotechnical cross-sections in the `output` directory.


### Configuration

Before running the script, ensure you configure the following key input parameters:

- **Number of Realizations**: The total number of synthetic images to generate.
- **Size in X**: The length of the model in pixels.
- **Size in Y**: The depth of the model in pixels.

These parameters can be adjusted within the `main.py` file.

## Output

GeoSyn outputs geotechnical cross-sections in both PNG and CSV formats, formatted to a size of 32x512 pixels to maintain a 1:16 ratio for length over depth. This ensures computational efficiency and visual fidelity.
